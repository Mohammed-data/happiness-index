## 🧠 Why I Did This

Between December and May, I tracked seven key areas of my life — mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, social, productivity, and overall happiness — to understand how they interact and evolve. This wasn’t about aesthetics or theory. It was real life, charted. The aim was to create clarity out of chaos and insight out of routine.

## 🧠 Reflections

- **Spirituality was my base** — it pulled me through emotional storms.
- **Discipline > Motivation.** Productivity grew through action, not inspiration.
- **Socials were helpful but not healing.** They supported — not solved — inner challenges.
- **The emotional curve was the slowest to change.** Peace came last.
- **Everything got better with intention.** Nothing improved by accident.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Excel** — for data entry and all visualizations
- **GitHub** — for project documentation and portfolio
- **RStudio (planned)** — for deeper stats (correlations, ARIMA forecasting)
- **Power BI (planned)** — to build an interactive dashboard

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Correlation matrix between all variables
- ARIMA forecasting in R to predict mood dips
- Publish blog reflection on Substack
- Build Power BI dashboard with filters and drilldowns

## 🧘 Final Note

I didn’t build this for a course or a challenge. I built it because I was lost, and needed data to speak when words couldn’t. If it resonates, that’s a bonus.

But it already did what I needed it to do.
